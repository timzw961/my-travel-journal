# My travel journal

This is the second solo project from the Scrimba React course. I used this project to test if I understand props and passing props as an object to a component. I think it turned out pretty well, and I was able to realise that using {requires ( ) } pretty much fixes the issues that the lecturer thought might happen with people doing the project on their local environment. The fix that he suggested was to throw everything into the public folder, but using the require method makes it work from the images folder. 

The process I've been following is now:
1) Complete the section from the react course
2) Complete the solo project from that section in Scrimba
3) Create-react-app in local environment for the section project (non-solo project, so in this section it was the AirBnB clone)
4) Copy over the code I had created and fix where necessary
5) Create another react app for GitHub pages and deploy into GitHub pages
6) Create-react-app in local environment for the section Solo Project
7) Copy over the work from Scrimba and change parts as necessary
8) Create another react app for GitHub pages and deploy

Random tidbit but I think for all of these GitHub pages I am making, I would probably have them incorporated or at least linked to in my actual portfolio website. I think I should also mention this somewhere during my journey in React that I hope to eventually be able to make and deploy my own portfolio website that showcases all the work I have done through my learnings. And for now, these will all be here in GitHub anyways to showcase what I have been working on :)

So I realised this format of journal could be a good idea to use for UOW students for their own UOW journey / checklist

Still need to work on some things - especially own portfolio website. This is just a reminder for myself
