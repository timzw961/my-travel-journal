# My travel journal

This is the second solo project from the Scrimba React course. I used this project to test if I understand props and passing props as an object to a component. I think it turned out pretty well, and I was able to realise that using {requires ( ) } pretty much fixes the issues that the lecturer thought might happen with people doing the project on their local environment. The fix that he suggested was to throw everything into the public folder, but using the require method makes it work from the images folder. 

The process I've been following is now:
1) Complete the section from the react course
2) Complete the solo project from that section in Scrimba
3) Create-react-app in local environment for the section project (non-solo project, so in this section it was the AirBnB clone)
4) Copy over the code I had created and fix where necessary
5) Create another react app for GitHub pages and deploy into GitHub pages
6) Create-react-app in local environment for the section Solo Project
7) Copy over the work from Scrimba and change parts as necessary
8) Create another react app for GitHub pages and deploy
